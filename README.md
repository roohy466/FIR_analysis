Here I expalin how to do FIR analysis with SPM. The sample data is a fMRI experimnt with 42 trials
The TR=2.2 and Interstimulus is about 14 to 17 sec which is a slow event-related design

The data are preprocessed with realignment and normalization and smoothing with 8mm. The data can be downloaded from the link:

to replicate the results you need spm12.
