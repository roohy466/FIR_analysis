# FIR_analysis
Here I expalin how to to FIR analysis with SPM. The sample data is a fMRI experimnt with 42 trials
The TR=2.2 and Interstimulus is about 14 to 17 sec which is a slow event-related design
The data are preprocessed with realignment and normalization and smoothing with 8mm.

I put the statistical analysis of one conditions 
to replicate the results you need spm12.

The FIR windows is 10 sec and the number of the boxcar functions are 5
